# CellTrackingEBA
This is my cell tracking package, for tracking cells in the limb field of the LPM. 

Most of it is function for aligning and registering the embryos after imaging, although there are also some statistics and calculations.
Everything is assuming the input is a time series from the Manual Tracking plugin on FIJI.
